For a few months, I have been thinking about setting up a blog. It seems to be an such an important tool for both [life and career](http://www.jeffbullas.com/2015/10/31/9-reasons-why-a-blog-is-important-career-life/). So, when I got the opportunity to start blogging as a Flatiron School student I was really excited. Here comes the first post. 

I have been studying at [Flatiron's online Learn-Verified program](https://flatironschool.com/campuses/online/) for slightly longer than a month already and things definitely are getting more complicated as we delve into object oriented Ruby. Since I am not very smart I really need to go over new concepts a few times before I can fully grasp them. For the really difficult ones (Collaborating Objects, I'm looking at you) even that doesn't help. For them, I noticed that things only start to click the next day after a good night's sleep (and of course, studying the day before). 

Looking over my personal journal, there are a few observations from the time in Flatiron I would like to share:

1. **Why and what**. Reminding myself of why am I doing what I'm doing and what are my goals is more important than ever. This is because success in Learn-Verified program really depends on the self-motivation as it is done completely online and on one's own pace. It is quite easy to get discouraged when trying to solve a problem that seems too hard and *why* is what keeps me going in those moments.

2. **Pry and repl.it are friends**. So many times when studying, at the first glance, things seem logical and I am under impression that I understand them, and it's very tempting to just move onto another lesson. However that has already came to haunt me back a few times and I definitely know better now. It's really important to get into details and have deep understanding of what is happening in the code. Only then, I am actually able to write something myself and make progress. Additionally, writing things down helps me memorize better. According to some research writing things by hands seem to [work even better](http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-using-pen-and-paper-not-laptops-boosts-memory-writing-notes-helps-recall-concepts-ability-268770), so that might be something to consider as well.

3. **It takes as long as it takes**. I have been stressing lately about insufficient speed of progress over some lessons, but then I realized that it is completely counter-productive and in fact self-sabotaging.  So right now, I don't really focus on speed but on what I can do every day to learn. I'll get there when I get there. I feel this removes the pressure and in fact helps with studying.

4. **Sketch the things first**. As the code I'm writing is getting more complicated, it really doesn't work anymore to just start coding. Because it will lead to plenty of head banging against the wall.  Although, this is a common advice, I really did not start practicing it myself until I was completely lost. The great thing is that once I make the plan and break the workflow into sections, things almost start coming together on their own. Meaning, I don't have all the answers from the beginning but eventually the solution will show itself as you come near to it. 

5. It is really satisfying once the tests pass or the program successfully executes. And definitely worth of every minute of sacrifice. :)

Onwards!
